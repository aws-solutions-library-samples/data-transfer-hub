If you encounter the following error message when creating the S3 plugin:

`is not authorized to perform: logs:DescribeMetricFilters on resource: arn:aws:logs:xxxxxx.`,

this is because of a recent change on AWS service policy, please follow below actions to fix:

1. Go to AWS [IAM role console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles), and search for `APICfnWorkflowCreateTaskCfnFnServi`, and choose the role which name is `DataTransferHub-APICfnWorkflowCreateTaskCfnFnServixxx-xxxxxxxxxxx`.

2. Click the icon on the right side of `APICfnWorkflowTaskFnPolicy`, and click **Edit**.

## Architecture

![](architecture.jpg)

A web portal is launched in the customer's AWS account. Through the web portal, customers can create data transfer 
tasks and manage them in a centralized place. When the user create a data transfer task through the web portal, the backend
invokes the CloudFormation API to deploy another stack to provision all resources to start data transfer. The solution 
only provision resources when needed. You can also choose to deploy the data transfer plugin independently. 

Available Plugins:
* [S3 Plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-s3-data-replication-hub-plugin)
* [ECR Plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-data-replication-hub-plugin)
