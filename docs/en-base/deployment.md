## Step 1. (Option 2) Launch the stack in AWS China Regions <a name="launch-openid"></a>

!!! warning "Important"

    The following deployment instructions apply to AWS China Regions only. For deployment in AWS Standard Regions refer to Option 1.  
    If you are deploying the solution in **AWS China Regions**, the domain must have a valid [ICP Recordal][icp]. 

### Prerequisites
1.	Create an OIDC User Pool. 
2.	Configure domain name service (DNS) resolution.

### Prerequisite 1: Create an OIDC user pool
In AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito is not yet available, you can use OIDC to provide authentication. The following procedure uses AWS Partner [Authing](https://www.authing.cn/) as an example, but you can also choose any available provider. 

1. Go to the [Authing console](https://console.authing.cn/console){target=_blank}.
2. Create a user pool if you don't have one.
3. Select the user pool.
4. On the left navigation bar, select **Self-built App** under **Applications**. 
5. Click the **Create** button.
6. Enter the **Application Name**, and **Subdomain**.
7. Save the `App ID` (that is, `client_id`) and `Issuer` to a text file from Endpoint Information, which will be used later.

8. Update the `Login Callback URL` and `Logout Callback URL` to your IPC recorded domain name.
    [![](./images/OIDC/authentication-configuration.png)](./images/OIDC/authentication-configuration.png)

9. Set the Authorization Configuration.
    [![](./images/OIDC/authorization-configuration.png)](./images/OIDC/authorization-configuration.png)
10. Update login control.
    1. Select and enter the **Application** interface from the left sidebar, select **Login Control**, and then select **Registration and Login**.
    2. Please select only **Password Login: Email** for the login method.
    3. Please **uncheck** all options in the registration method.
    4. Select **Save**.

11. Create an admin user.
    1. From **Users & Roles**, select **Users**, then choose **Create user**.
    2. Enter the email for the user. 
    3. Choose **OK**. 
    4. Check the email for a temporary password. 
    5. Reset the user password.

    !!! note "Note"
        Because this solution does not support application roles, all the users will receive admin rights. 

### Prerequisite 2: Configure domain name service resolution 
Configure domain name service (DNS) resolution to point the ICP licensed domain to the CloudFront default domain name. Optionally, you can use your own DNS resolver. 

The following is an example for configuring an Amazon Route 53.

1. Create a hosted zone in Amazon Route 53. For more information, refer to the [Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html).

2. Create a CNAME record for the console URL.

    1. From the hosted zone, choose **Create Record**.
    1. In the **Record name** input box, enter the host name.
    1. From **Record type** select **CNAME**.
    1. In the value field, Enter the CloudFormation output PortalUrl. 
    1. Select **Create records**.

3. Add alternative domain names to the CloudFront distribution.

    1. Configure the corresponding domain name in CloudFront to open the CloudFront console by finding the distribution ID for PortalURL in the list and selecting **ID** (or check the check box, and then select **Distribution Settings**).
    1. Click **Edit**, and add the record of Route 53 in the previous step to the `Alternate Domain Name (CNAME)`.

**Deploy the AWS CloudFormation template for Option 2 – AWS China Regions**

This automated AWS CloudFormation template deploys Data Transfer Hub in the AWS Cloud. You must Create an ODIC User Pool and Configure DNS resolution before launching the stack.
